beam,1974,review,100887469,"What is the relationship between ""dataflow counters"" and ""metric updates""?  This comment refers to counters, while the code below refers to metric update protos.  Should this comment instead mention translating accumulators for metric updates so that this class should be renamed accordingly?
Also, the naming of the methods below is confusing: two arguments are passed, e.g. set_boolean(accumulator, metric_update_proto).  Just reading this signature suggests that the accumulator will somehow have a boolean set from metric_update_proto, which is the opposite of what is intended.  Can you instead rename these methods translate_*, e.g. for translate_boolean(accumulator, metric_update_proto)?  This would make it clear that we are translating accumulator into metric_update_proto.  If you do this, can you rename set_scalar and set_mean in this file as well?",code_debt,low_quality_code

spark,8760,review,45791721,"can you change these params to `maxFailedTasks` and `maxBlacklistedExecutors`, and change the comment to:
This strategy adds an executor to the blacklist for _all_ tasks when the executor has too many task failures.  An executor is placed in the blacklist when there are more than [[maxFailedTasks]] failed tasks.  Furthermore, all executors in one node are put into the blacklist if there are more than [[maxBlacklistedExecutors]] blacklisted executors on one node.  The benefit of this strategy is that different taskSets can learn experience from other taskSet to avoid allocating tasks on problematic executors.",non_debt,-

I'm wondering how bad this cyclic dependency and the need for mutable state is, though. From a user's perspective, the existing interfaces are a bit easier and more convenient to use. On the down side, it makes the implementation a bit harder and harder to test in isolation. However, do we want to test the `Scheduling*` implementations in isolation?

spark,31905,comment,811106021,"Regarding your questions:
Can you provide a common streaming use case where a non-event-base processing of metrics is useful? The `Observation` proposes a ""get me the metrics"" API that hides listeners and multi-threading. In streaming context, there are no finite metrics.
Can you elaborate on this, please? Do you mean an async `get`? Can you provide some pseudo-code on how to use the metrics async.
It is not thread-safe in a scenario where the action on the observed dataset is called in a different thread than where the metrics are retrieved. I'd say such a multi-thread driver process is not the general use case for batch processing. Even if, the proposed `Observation` API aims at hiding multi-threading complexity so that users can use `Dataset.observe` in single-threaded scenarios. Users that are experience with multi-threading have no problem in using the existing listeners approach. They are not the target user of this extension.

incubator-pinot,5769,review,467200428,"I think both ways have some pros and cons. I personally think that using a single endpoint is easier for users?
* The main purpose of online AD endpoint is to provide a convenient way to run AD tasks so the endpoint should be as simple as possible. Using a single endpoint is more user-friendly. Using a separate CRUD endpoint does allow more flexibility but it will ask users to firstly register their data before using this service.
* Secondly, online service will not allow much too large size of data so in my sense, sending data in the request every time is not a bottleneck?
I think we could provide both ways. This is phase 1 for this feature. In phase 2, we probably could support another two endpoints to support what you suggested. 
Regarding the cleanup, I think currently in phase 1, it is just a one-call request so I mentioned this as stateless because users will not have a separate endpoint to retrieve anomalies afterwards and hence we could clean up them. In phase 2, another two endpoints will be provided and for those endpoints, we do not need to do the cleanup.

Here are some useful points:
- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.
- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.
- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.
- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.
- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).

beam,11020,review,387292177,"It's an arbitrary name we give to the jQuery v3.4.1 we imported. It's like a namesapce. Note the magic happens in `window.jquery341 = jQuery.noConflict(true);`.
The problem here is that:
1. A frontend can connect to the kernel at any time: code executed by kernel in the past does not have any effect to new frontends.
2. Multiple frontends can connect to the same kernel: each frontend has its own state (browser: HTML and JS), the rendered HTML+JS cannot assume the existence of any global variable, function definition or libraries.
This ensures no matter how many jQuery gets imported at any time, the interactive notebook always checks and uses the single jQuery configured by interactive modules with Datatable plugin initialized.
And the `function($)` signature ensures that any customized script executed will use `$` as the singleton instance  `window.jquery341`. This ensures that code reading `$` as jQuery will always work.
The advantage of doing this isolation is:
1. The JS imported by interactive modules to any frontend does not alter their existing states. Everything in the notebook still works as it was no matter what libraries and global vars have been used.
2. HTML with JS rendered by interactive modules will have determined behavior because it always uses the same libraries.
3. Whether/when a frontend is connected to the kernel doesn't matter now. The visualization HTML contains everything it needs to setup and/or execute scripts.
4. Arbitrary DOM changes doesn't matter now. Even if the user screws the notebook's HTML, the data visualization broadcast from kernels will always be rendered correctly.",non_debt,-

I don't disagree on preferring this to be split out and handled separately, but practically speaking I was working under a number of constraints that made it more difficult. First, TypeScript released v3.3+ with breaking changes to type resolution halfway through the process of working on these features (leading to [this issue]( https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4452)).
Second, I was using the new Builders in app code as they were being developed. The apps needed TS 3.5, but wouldn't compile without these fixes, so I had to update Arrow.

spark,23260,comment,455328233,"@squito Yes, exactly. Nice summarization.
IMHO there're some cases we still want to get custom log URL while the status of application is ""in progress"", because according to the logic on determining whether the application is finished, app could be shown as ""inprogress"" when the app terminated unexpectedly.
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0b3abef1950f486001160ec578e4f628c199eeb4/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/HistoryPage.scala#L98-L100
In this case, showing origin log URLs may not work but showing custom log URLs would work if the external log service gathers executor logs continuously rather than gathering logs when app is finished - I expect the behavior of external log service as former not latter. Even if app is still running, app UI will still provide origin log URLs so we can get it from there instead of SHS.
What I agreed to make change on only SHS was my prev. patch was making log urls being static again which is fragile if there's a change on external log service. Now we just require end users to modify the configuration and restart SHS (unless there's a cache mechanism to avoid re-reading events when restarting SHS.) IMHO, showing custom log URLs even for apps which are shown as ""inprogress"" still makes sense to me. 
Btw, I didn't add variables for other resource managers as they don't provide log URLs for now. (If possible we may be better to address it as well via separate PRs.)",non_debt,-

kafka,5519,comment,414969484,"@ijuma If I understand your comment correctly, you are talking about calling `RequestBuilder.build()` only once to address this issue without modifying the Request class itself. Here are my thoughts:
- Controller has separate request send threads talking to brokers and each of them contains a separate network client. Although we pass in the same request builder to each of the network clients, we cannot ensure that `RequestBuilder.build()` is called only once because we currently don't maintain states across these network clients. However, we can explicitly cache the request object in the RequestBuilder to avoid re-instantiation (this is what this PR did).
- Even if we can ensure `RequestBuilder.build()` is called only once and we use the same request object in the network clients, in the current implementation we will still create multiple Struct objects each time we serialize the request when network clients are trying to send out the request. To avoid that, this PR caches the Struct object and re-uses it when `toStruct()` is called.
Although this is a general optimization for all types of request, this PR only changes `UpdateMetadataRequest` instead of `AbstractRequest` because `UpdateMetadataRequest` is the only use case where we send out requests with the same payload for multiple times.",non_debt,-

the issue is that mac by default does not include openmp by default and therefore a guard was added to prevent users from trying to build with this. the developer should instead not build with openmp enabled on mac and the Makefile should not attempt to catch this (the user may falsely believe they are using openmp when they are not).
- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)
- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)
- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)
- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. 
- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. 
- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable

druid,6230,description,0,"This patch includes the following bug fixes:
- TopNColumnSelectorStrategyFactory: Cast dimension values to the output type
  during dimExtractionScanAndAggregate instead of updateDimExtractionResults.
  This fixes a bug where, for example, grouping on doubles-cast-to-longs would
  fail to merge two doubles that should have been combined into the same long value.
- TopNQueryEngine: Use DimExtractionTopNAlgorithm when treating string columns
  as numeric dimensions. This fixes a similar bug: grouping on string-cast-to-long
  would fail to merge two strings that should have been combined.
- GroupByQuery: Cast numeric types to the expected output type before comparing them
  in compareDimsForLimitPushDown. This fixes #6123.
- GroupByQueryQueryToolChest: Convert Jackson-deserialized dimension values into
  the proper output type. This fixes an inconsistency between results that came
  from cache vs. not-cache: for example, Jackson sometimes deserializes integers
  as Integers and sometimes as Longs.
And the following code-cleanup changes, related to the fixes above:
- DimensionHandlerUtils: Introduce convertObjectToType, compareObjectsAsType,
  and converterFromTypeToType to make it easier to handle casting operations.
- TopN in general: Rename various ""dimName"" variables to ""dimValue"" where they
  actually represent dimension values. The old names were confusing.

spark,15148,comment,259376702,"I tend to agree that the terminology used here is a little confusing, and doesn't seem to match up with the ""general"" terminology (I use that term loosely however).
In my dealings with LSH, I too have tended to come across the version that @sethah mentions (and @karlhigley's package, and others such as https://github.com/marufaytekin/lsh-spark, implement). that is, each input vector is hashed into `L` ""tables"" of hash signatures of ""length"" or ""dimension"" `d`. Each hash signature is created by concatenating the result of applying `d` ""hash functions"".
I agree what's effectively implemented here is `L = outputDim` and `d=1`. What I find a bit troubling is that it is done ""implicitly"", as part of the `hashDistance` function. Without knowing that is what is happening, it is not clear to a new user - coming from other common LSH implementations - that `outputDim` is not the ""number of hash functions"" or ""length of the hash signatures"" but actually the ""number of hash tables"".
In terms of `transform` - I disagree somewhat that the main use case is ""dimensionality reduction"". Perhaps there are common examples of using the hash signatures as a lower-dim representation as a feature in some model (e.g. in a similar way to say a PCA transform), but I haven't seen that. In my view, the real use case is the approximate nearest neighbour search.
I'll give a concrete example for the `transform` output. Let's say I want to export recommendation model factor vectors (from ALS), or Word2Vec vectors, etc, to a real-time scoring system. I have many items, so I'd like to use LSH to make my scoring feasible. I do this by effectively doing a real-time version of OR-amplification. I store the hash tables (`L` tables of `d` hash signatures) with my vectors. When doing ""similar items"" for a given item, I retrieve the hash sigs of the query item, and use these to filter down the candidate item set for my scoring. This is in fact something I'm working on in a demo project currently. So if we will support the OR/AND combo, then it will be very important to output the full `L x d` set of hash sigs in `transform`.
My recommendation is: 
1. future proof the API by returning `Array[Vector]` in `transform` (as mentioned above by others);
2. we need to update the docs / user guide to make it really clear what the implementation is doing;
3. I think we need to make it clear that the implied `d` value here is `1` - we can mention that AND amplification will be implemented later and perhaps even link to a JIRA.
4. rename `outputDim` to something like `numHashTables`.
5. when we add AND-amp, we can add the parameter `hashSignatureLength` or `numHashFunctions`.
6. make as much private as possible to avoid being stuck with any implementation detail in future releases (e.g. I also don't see why `randUnitVectors` or `randCoefficients` needs to be public).
One issue I have is that currently we would output a `1 x L` set of hash values. But it actually should be `L x 1` i.e. a set of signatures of length `1`. I guess we can leave it as is, but document what the output actually is.
I believe we should support OR/AND in future. If so, then to me many things need to change - `hashFunction`, `hashDistance` etc will need to be refactored. Most of the implementation is private/protected so I think it will be ok. Let's just ensure we're not left with an API that we can't change in future. Setting `L` and `d=1` must then yield the same result as current impl to avoid a behavior change (I guess this will be ok since current default for `L` is `1`, and we can make the default for `d` when added also `1`).
Finally, my understanding was results from some performance testing would be posted. I don't believe we've seen this yet.",design_debt,non-optimal_design

More Info as to why it fails on secure grid:
Oozie client gets the necessary tokens the application needs before launching. It passes those tokens along to the oozie launcher job (MR job) which will then actually call the Spark client to launch the spark app and pass the tokens along.
The oozie launcher job cannot get anymore tokens because all it has is tokens ( you can't get tokens with tokens, you need tgt or keytab).
The error here is because the launcher job runs the Spark Client to submit the spark job but the spark client doesn't see that it already has the hdfs tokens so it tries to get more, which ends with the exception.
There was a change with SPARK-19021 to generalize the hdfs credentials provider that changed it so we don't pass the existing credentials into the call to get tokens so it doesn't realize it already has the necessary tokens.

I think the ways forward are probably:
- A new lifecycle method like `clear()`? more user burden but at least provides _some_ means of doing cleanup without changing `close()`
- Figure out how to automatically dispose of those resources or not hold them
- Just change the behavior of session's `close()` to not shut down the context. Behavior change, yes, but perhaps less surprising than anything.

parquet-mr,808,comment,672774756,"@shangxinli,
If we will agree on the extending of the schema with metadata is a good idea and as you said the serialization/deserialization is also required we need to change the format first. The schema objects in parquet-mr are only exist in the parquet-mr runtime. To have them serialized we need to convert this object structure to the thrift object structure defined in the format. If we don't have the new metatdata fields in the format we cannot serialize/deserialize them. So it is a much bigger topic. Also, I'd like to see this feature separated from the encryption as it would be general approach for storing metadata in the schema. Meanwhile, I am not convinced that we need to have such extension.
About the namespace prefix etc. I don't agree this is not user friendly. That's why I've suggested to implement a helper API so the user doesn't need to deal with the conf keys (and values) directly. 
@ggershinsky,
I don't agree we cannot have a meeting about this topic in terms of transparency. What we have to do is to document here about what we have discussed and what are the conclusions. Meanwhile, I am not sure if a meeting would help but I am happy to participate if anyone thinks otherwise.

spark,23272,description,0,"In `BytesToBytesMap.MapIterator.advanceToNextPage`, We will first lock this `MapIterator` and then `TaskMemoryManager` when going to free a memory page by calling `freePage`. At the same time, it is possibly that another memory consumer first locks `TaskMemoryManager` and then this `MapIterator` when it acquires memory and causes spilling on this `MapIterator`.
So it ends with the `MapIterator` object holds lock to the `MapIterator` object and waits for lock on `TaskMemoryManager`, and the other consumer holds lock to `TaskMemoryManager` and waits for lock on the `MapIterator` object.
To avoid deadlock here, this patch proposes to keep reference to the page to free and free it after releasing the lock of `MapIterator`.
Added test and manually test by running the test 100 times to make sure there is no deadlock.",non_debt,-

Getting the XSDs/DTDs at runtime would be perfectly doable, but the modules would need to be reworked to no rely on code generated at build-time.
@vikasprabhakar the DTD files are present here:
https://www.jboss.org/j2ee/dtd/
The files are missing an explicit license and as such I would assume they are covered by the projects LGPL license. That at least is reflected in some of the XSDs I saw.

pulsar,5592,description,0,"Fixes #5589 
It seems that there is a memory leak in the pulsar-function-go library.
I implemented a simple pulsar function worker that just write logs using pulsar-function-go/logutil for sending logs to log topic. I tried to long-term test by sending request messages consecutively to the input topic to check the feasibility.
During the test, I faced `ProducerQueueIsFull` error with `--log-topic` option. And I observed indefinitely grown memory usage of the pulsar function worker process.
Clear the `StrEntry` variable after finish addLogTopicHandler() function regardless of the log messages are appended to logger or not. If it is not cleared, it causes memory leak because StrEntry has grown indefinitely. Moreover, if the function set --log-topic, then the topic could get accumulated huge messages that cause ProducerQueueIsFull error.
Verified it by reproducing step described in the issue #5589.",design_debt,non-optimal_design

superset,4941,description,0,"# Summary
* Add functionality to wrap SQL Lab queries with a limit
A common problem people have is that they input a query in SqlLab to preview their data before hitting visualize to create a table, and then it takes forever to run. This can be a pain (on them and potentially on the database).
Currently one workaround is to manually enter a limit in the query editor, visualizing (which creates the datasource), and then later removing it from the base query (by editing the created datasource). With this in mind, an additional/alternative solution might be to allow users to edit the sub-query in the visualize modal before creating their datasource.
So here's a way to have a limit only in the context of SQL editor. The limit is only applied as a wrapper for select queries, and not saved in any persistent database.
https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4834 - I like this idea, but not sure if every database supports prefetching. If going with this route, I'd have a configurable page size.

phoenix,936,comment,724872173,"1. Not sure about it but we can introduce additional constraints like the total size of scanned bytes as you suggested to further improve this feature later. 
2. This is correct. By itself, it does not eliminate. However, the client can wait for all the page operation to complete or fail before returning to the application, as an additional improvement. This will further reduce the race conditions. I think we have to enforce the client side timestamp to make the race almost impossible.
3. I expect this feature will improve the overall performance and availability since paging limits the memory usage and the time to hold server resources. My experience with paging on a real cluster is very positive.  I have not seen any negative impact yet as long as the page size is not very small (e.g., less than 1000).",design_debt,non-optimal_design

I don't think we can use a reference either, because the UnboundedSource is Serializable and any runner is free to clone it (which is what DirectRunner does, afaik). The best solution would seem to be to mark each initially split (via @SplitRestriction) restriction with unique ID and then transfer this ID to all residual restrictions. There should be always be at most one ""active"" (either currently being processed or having non-null residual) restriction, so we could use that for identifying the reader without referencing Source (which might be problematic, as implementing hashCode and/or equals for UnboundedSource will not be a common practice, I'm afraid).",code_debt,low_quality_code

The code looks good except what @vesense commented. 
Two things more to address:
1. It would be better to document new configurations. Without documentation, end-users have no idea about added feature. `external/storm-hbase/README.md` and `docs/storm-hbase.md`.
2. The code already uses JDK 8 API (Map.getOrDefault()), so can't get it as it is for 1.x. Could you provide a new PR for 1.x branch?
It would be also great if you can test it (with Caffeine) on JRE7 (expected to not work but we can document the precondition for JRE version) and JRE8 (expected to work).

The context here is just to have a way to read through a topic (eg: support `TopicReader`) and reuse as much code as possible from the regular cursor implementation. Basically all the cache code and the logic for how to switch to ""next valid position"", plus the asyncReadOrWait stuff.
About non impeding messages to be deleted, consider that in case of non-durable topic, during a disconnection the cursor will go away and data will get potentially deleted anyway. So I prefer it to be explicitly ingrained into the API. Same thing about naming the cursor. It will go away in any case after a restart, so I don't see the advantage of naming it.
When data gets deleted, the cursor will just skip over it. The intended usage for the non-durable cursor and topic reader is in conjunction with the message retention, to make sure data sticks around for the intended amount of time",code_debt,low_quality_code

kafka,7248,review,338615161,"What I settled on is that the `validVersions` would be a range encompassing all the supported protocol versions. The individual fields would use an open range when they're added (like `3+`), and then use a closed range when they are removed. For example, in KIP-441, we're going to set `validVersions: 1-6` and then set (for example) `prevTasks: 1-5`, while adding new fields `6+`.
This scheme would give us the smallest diff when we do have to bump the protocol version without changing any fields (which happens with some regularity). It also makes the most intuitive sense, IMHO, to use open ranges for the fields when you add them, because you would just assume they'll remain part of the protocol indefinitely.",non_debt,-

Like I mentioned the listing (/api/v1/applications) and /api/v1/applications/<app-id> (which is same info I believe as listing) were intentionally left open.  I don't really see a reason to change that but if other people have a use case for it then perhaps we should make which pages are protected by acls configurable.  
on the history server I would expect spark.acls.enable=false and spark.history.ui.acls.enable=true, I can see where that could be confusing, perhaps we should document this better. spark.acls.enable on the history UI really is protecting the root UI, not the app level ui's.

kafka,6517,comment,484309340,"@hzxa21 Thanks for the code review.
1)	This consistently happens on Windows platform. I have seen few people complaining similar issues for some Linux flavors, but consensus is this is not an issue for most of the popular Linux flavors. This is a classic windows problem where if a handle is open for a file, NTFS does not allow it to be renamed / moved / deleted. All the file handles open on the file are required to be closed before renaming them. This is not much of an issue with Linux because of the way Linux file system is implemented. The way files are implemented in Linux, it allows to rename / move / delete files even if there are open handles to them.
The way I think about this patch is, before renaming any files / directories, we should always close the file channels. This is applicable to Linux as well. There are 2 fundamental scenarios. 
a)	Deletion of directories since the topic is deleted and deletion of segment files by cleaner thread. We believe, we should close the log file in case of log deletion and close the segment in case of segment file cleanup. Since no one should be reading these files, it is safe to close.
b)	 During swapping flow, where ‘.cleaned’ files are renamed to ‘.swap’ files and then they are renamed to actual log files. Here also we believe segment should be closed during renaming and re-opened after the swap.
Overall gist is, files should be closed before renaming them and should be opened back if required. This should be applicable to Linux as well
2)	Yes, initially we implemented the change in rename files method. But that change turned out to be 
ugly. Here is the abandoned pull request done such way.
https://github.com/Microsoft/kafka/pull/17/files
Problem was, there was no need to re-open ‘.deleted’ files. So we had put an if check to not to re-open ‘.deleted’ file. Also, it resulted in changes at many places.
Also, I felt like it was not a cleaner fix where we are not solving the root problem. Which is to close the segment before they are renamed / deleted. Also, we wanted this to be a generic fix, rather than specific to Windows.
3)	Yes, I can add some test cases. We wanted to get a initial feedback on the idea before adding tests.",code_debt,low_quality_code

If possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.

The `TableProvider` only accepts table schema and properties. It should accept table partitioning as well.
This is extracted from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25651, to only keep the API changes and make the diff smaller.
-->
Although `DataFrameReader`/`DataStreamReader` don't support user-specified partitioning, we need to pass the table partitioning when getting tables from `TableProvider` if we store tables in Hive metastore with v2 provider.

spark,3157,comment,67773705,"The `NoSuchMethodError` was caused by wrong datanucleus-core version. The target method is defined in datanucleus-core 3.2.2 but not in 3.2.10. The former is used when compiling against Hive 0.12.0, while the latter is used when compiling against Hive 0.13.1. Currently on Jenkins we first do a clean compile against 0.12.0, then build the assembly jar _without_ clean against 0.13.1 and run the tests.
This behavior left both versions of datanucleus-core in the `lib_managed` directory, and may sometimes mess up class paths. I'll open a PR to clean `lib_managed` before compiling Hive 0.13.1 in `dev/run-tests`.

spark,31638,review,586286229,"Let's focus on ""glob path"" here - from the quick look on org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem javadoc, both `isDirectory()` and `exists()` seem to require the exact path, not glob path. The method which accept glob path is `globStatus()`, and there the API clearly names the parameter as `pathPattern`.
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.html
And intuitively, it sounds very odd to me if someone can say the glob path is a directory while matching paths can be both files and directories, and same for checking existence as well. I don't think it's feasible to ""expect"" the meaningful value from calling these methods with glob path. That sounds to me as ""undefined behavior"" even any weird file system could return true for the case.
That said, I'd rather consider the input of glob path as ""wrong one"" and always return false (some sort of debug log message is fine if we really like to log). If there's a code relying on such behavior, I don't think that is correct. I'd rather say the possible paths should be populated before, and this method should be called per each path.
I still need to hear voices from others, but if the consensus goes to just disallow the glob path here, we won't need to introduce the new configuration.

tvm,5365,description,0,"In #5288, we moved Inline after the second fusion to avoid fusion checks the OpPattern of certain ops that can be eliminated by simplify inference pass, i.e. batch_norm, as external codegen needs to keep them. However, as memory passes should happen as a whole, this may introduce bugs. For example, we may have to bind constants first, like the change in the unit test. This fix reverts the change, but stopping fusing the function that should be handled by external codegen in fuse_op. 
This indicates that we may need to think about a more systematic way to skip functions inside a pass. Although outlining and inlining was used for the functions that are control by pass manager, it is not sufficient in such case.

But that means someone has to run that command on every single spark application running on that cluster, correct?  That doesn't seem very feasible on any relatively large cluster.  One big question I have is, are there enough use cases where just the command is useful?  Otherwise we are temporarily adding a command that we will have to keep supporting forever (or perhaps only the next major release).    Or does it make sense to wait for YARN (or another resource manager) to have full support for this?",non_debt,-

spark,16728,description,0,"This PR is to revert the changes made in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16700. It could cause the data loss after partition rename, because we have a bug in the file renaming. 
Not all the OSs have the same behaviors. For example, on mac OS, if we renaming a path from `.../tbl/a=5/b=6` to `.../tbl/A=5/B=6`. The result is `.../tbl/a=5/B=6`. The expected result is `.../tbl/A=5/B=6`. Thus, renaming on mac OS is not recursive. However, the systems used in Jenkin does not have such an issue. Although this PR is not the root cause, it exposes an existing issue on the code `tablePath.getFileSystem(hadoopConf).rename(wrongPath, rightPath)`
--- 
Hive metastore is not case preserving and keep partition columns with lower case names.
If SparkSQL create a table with upper-case partion name use HiveExternalCatalog, when we rename partition, it first call the HiveClient to renamePartition, which will create a new lower case partition path, then SparkSql rename the lower case path to the upper-case.
while if the renamed partition contains more than one depth partition ,e.g. A=1/B=2, hive renamePartition change to a=1/b=2, then SparkSql rename it to A=1/B=2, but the a=1 still exists in the filesystem, we should also delete it.

trafficserver,3044,description,0,"Hello,
As far as I can see, and understand, the option `--enable-docs` doesn't work as expected in 7.1.2.
In `configure.ac`:
`enable_doc_build` is set to `no` if option is missing. If option is provided, nothing is done.
Then, `BUILD_DOCS` is set to true only if `enable_doc_build` is set to `yes` which seems to be unlikely to happen.
In `configure`:
If `--enable-docs` option isn't provided, `enable_doc_build` is set to `no` and never set to `yes` if option is provided.
When testing `enable_doc_build` to set `BUILD_DOCS_TRUE` and `BUILD_DOCS_FALSE`, first case is never triggered, leading to `enable_doc_build` to be always empty.
This means BUILD_DOCS_TRUE will be always equal to '#', thus leading man pages generation to be disabled in `doc/Makefile.in`:",non_debt,-

spark,15573,description,0,"Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18035
In HiveInspectors, I saw that converting Java map to Spark's `ArrayBasedMapData` spent quite sometime in buffer copying : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveInspectors.scala#L658
The reason being `map.toSeq` allocates a new buffer and copies the map entries to it: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/collection/MapLike.scala#L323
This copy is not needed as we get rid of it once we extract the key and value arrays.
Here is the call trace:
Also, earlier code was populating keys and values arrays separately by iterating twice. The PR avoids double iteration of the map and does it in one iteration.
EDIT: During code review, there were several more places in the code which were found to do similar thing. The PR dedupes those instances and introduces convenient APIs which are performant and memory efficient
The number is subjective and depends on how many map columns are accessed in the query and average entries per map. For one the queries that I tried out, I saw 3% CPU savings (end-to-end) for the query.
This does not change the end result produced so relying on existing tests.",code_debt,duplicated_code

spark,30392,comment,729168362,"I think so. In some cases, unnecessary executor-side reduce might invoke an additional map task although it just returns the single element. So this is just a minor concern for me.
The other thing is, `takeOrdered` is introduced into RDD API earlier than `treeReduce`. So I guess we may not consider to use `treeReduce` in this place before. For the nature of `takeOrdered` that sequences of elements are collected to the driver and reduced. It sounds a good fit for `treeReduce` as we can partially reduce before collecting to the driver. There is an overhead but sounds like a trade-off. Driver side usually a bottleneck for such case. The driver-side reduce is not parallel and also bound to local memory for all data.

incubator-mxnet,14769,description,0,"This adds a fine tuning example for BERT based off of the following Gluon NLP example
[https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentence_embedding/bert.html](https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentence_embedding/bert.html)
There is a PR in the GluonNLP repo for the export script https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/672
The original BERT infer example directory has been changed from `bert-qa` to `bert` to accomodate both the QA example and this one.
A walkthrough in the form of a Jupyter notebook has been provided for the sentence pair classification based off of the Gluon NLP one. A markdown version of the notebook has also been provided for those who don't have the `lein-jupyter` plugin.
Example results for sentence pair classification after 3 epochs:
which is comparable to the sentence embedding results in the gluon nlp notebook
- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)
- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)
- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)
- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. 
- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. 
- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable
- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html
- Move BERT QA infer example within a broader BERT example
- Add BERT Sentence Pair Classification Example along with notebook
- Tweak the Callback Speedometer so that the results will be printed out in the notebook instead of having to look at the console for the logging.
- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.

spark,4593,comment,75540678,"I have the same concern as @dbtsai in his comment. Most consumers of this API will already be caching their dataset before the learning phase. Without user care, this will introduce effectively double caching (in terms of data size of cached RDDs) and will cause many jobs to fail after upgrading by exceeding available heap for RDD cache. Furthermore, we are making assumptions about how to cache -- in-memory only in this case. Should we parameterise this? Perhaps that will help send the message in the API that there is caching also done before learning. (FWIW, in-memory is definitely the right default choice here.)

spark,21322,comment,429410774,"@cloud-fan (Also left on the JIRA ticket) - Sorry this has dropped off my radar for so long - work + life took me away from it for a while. So looking at the PR review comments and better understanding Broadcast Variable behavior (and some of the changes that took place in the 2.X series), it seems like simply trying to close Broadcast variables won't work as intended. However, I believe the underlying concept (driver-scoped shared variables, where the variable lives until the job is done or the driver removes it) is still worth pursuing. Being able to scope shared resources (like DB connection pools, which may need to change per phase of a job, or be able to be disposed of early in a process, which makes static variables not useful). Given that, I'd like to propose we add a new concept, similar to Broadcast Variables, called, perhaps, Scoped Variables. The intent would be for these to be scoped by the driver, be relatively small from a memory-consumption perspective (unlike broadcast variables, which can be much larger), and to be held in memory until explicitly removed by the driver. Most of the infrastructure work for broadcast variables supports this use-case, but we'd need to have either a ""non-purgable"" type in the MemoryStore, or some other store specific to these new scoped variables, in order to prevent them from being evicted like cached items are.
Thoughts on this? I'll start working on updating the PR to support something like this sometime today, but it might still take a while to get something workable put together, so I'd appreciate any feedback when someone has the time.",non_debt,-

The setup is
MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)
2.8 GHz Intel Core i7
16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
macOS 10.12.6
java version ""1.8.0_121""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)
The versions tested are 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT (b24f5d87cbcd4faeed651e45a8e673db52469a46)
Metrics V2 (78d3de44cf0705efd199fb64b7ef092e23c3285b) which is 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT + 99bcf68 merged in.
The Numbers:
1.2.0-SNAPSHOT
Metrics V2:
At 50,000 sentences per second on a single worker both can keep up, but the mean latency appears to be about 200 to 300 microseconds slower 9.6 ms vs 9.9 ms.  The bigger issue in my mind is the CPU time as it went up from about 79 seconds (max 30 second period) every 30 seconds to 92 seconds (min 30 second period after stabilizing). That was at least a 16% increase in CPU usage.
At 75,000 sentences per second metrics v2 was just able to keep up with that throughput while 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT could handle it easily. I will not compare the latency because metrics v2 didn't stabilize enough for me to feel good reporting the numbers, but the CPU time went up from 118 seconds every 30 seconds to 130 seconds.  That was an increase of at least 9%.
When I tried to do 100,000 sentences per second neither of the two could keep up, but 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT hit a maximum of 97k while metrics V2 hit a maximum of 78k or 20% less maximum throughput.  Only here did we see the CPU usage be lower for metrics V2 with 134 seconds vs 141 for 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT, but if we take into account the actual throughput and look at CPU seconds needed to process 1k sentences per second it is 1.7 for metrics v2 vs 1.5 for 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.

zookeeper,1257,comment,593204387,"looks good. I still have another thought(no binding for the following, you can ignore it):
- Since the root cause is a narrow windows between `queuePacket` and `cleanup`, so synchronized `objectLock` is also an alternative way? which one is better? Since `outgoingQueue` is a critical Queue for client to talk with server, synchronized `outgoingQueue` will have performance and future program extensibility issue?
Haha, I also test for the `global` and `inner` wording by the following way:
- new two different zookeeper clients, create some znodes, printing the `hashcode` of `outgoingQueue` and `state`. They really hold different `outgoingQueue`, but the same hashcode of `state`. it really confuses me.
- I believe different clients will have different `state` instance, otherwise when one client calls `close()`(set `state` to `CLOSE`), it will affect another client. However, using following ways cannot reason about it.
`javap` to see the bytecode, the value set to `state` is `public static final`, so it's really global-shared by multi-clients.
- synchronized `Enum` is also not thread-safe. Look at my demo attached in JIRA.
- In a word, `Enum` is a heresy:)",design_debt,non-optimal_design

spark,14079,review,88088492,"well, I think it depends what you mean by ""handled correctly"".  We use the time the taskset completes, so its OK if the failures happened long ago when the taskset started, we still count those failures in the app blacklist, so later failures can trickle in and push us over the limit.
OTOH, this also means that if we were already close to the limit on failures for the application when this taskset started, then a really long running taskset will fail to push us over the limit -- by the time the latest task set finishes, we've expired the old failures, so we only get failures from the new taskset.  So if your taskset time is longer than the blacklist timeout, you're unlikely to ever get application level blacklisting.
Clearly this is not great, but its not _that_ bad.  After all, even if it were app-level blacklisted, we'd hit still the timeout and remove the bad resources from the blacklist, so that we'd need to rediscover it in future blacklists.  One of the main reasons for the app-level blacklist is to avoid lots of failures when the tasksets are _short_.  If you really want an application level blacklist which is useful across really long tasksets, then you've got to crank up your timeout.
We could change this slightly by _first_ updating the application level blacklist, and _then_ expiring failures past the timeout.  But to me that behavior seems much less intuitive, for a pretty questionable gain.
Does that make sense?  What do you think?",non_debt,-

samza,230,review,124421458,"@sborya I agree it is pretty convoluted how we are doing this. However, @prateekm and I have discussed this option extensively in the past when we are working on [SAMZA-1212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-1212). 
As I explained before , it is not fully clear how to wire-in the source of the stop and cause of the stop of a streamprocessor across the components. I don't believe it is as straightforward as passing in a `Throwable`. It could work. It becomes particularly tricky for bounded jobs or jobs that decide to stop themselves using TaskCoordinator. The approach you are suggesting is equivalent to threading a needle , where we will end up passing around the state/source of the `stop` across the components' api and callbacks. 
The alternative and more straightforward solution, imo, is to clearly define a state model for each components and persist/manage the status in the streamprocessor. That way, it will make it easier for streamprocessor to take remediation steps.
We can discuss more on this. However, this PR is simply a bug-fix. We should scrutinize the refactoring/behavior of the APIs in a separate thread/JIRA. What do you think?",design_debt,non-optimal_design

nit: I would rename the test to `shouldReturnEmptyIteratorForRangeQueryWithInvalidKeyRange`.

spark,15272,description,0,"Jira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17698
`ExtractEquiJoinKeys` is incorrectly using filter predicates as the join condition for joins. `canEvaluate` [0] tries to see if the an `Expression` can be evaluated using output of a given `Plan`. In case of filter predicates (eg. `a.id='1'`), the `Expression` passed for the right hand side (ie. '1' ) is a `Literal` which does not have any attribute references. Thus `expr.references` is an empty set which theoretically is a subset of any set. This leads to `canEvaluate` returning `true` and `a.id='1'` is treated as a join predicate. While this does not lead to incorrect results but in case of bucketed + sorted tables, we might miss out on avoiding un-necessary shuffle + sort. See example below:
[0] : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/predicates.scala#L91
eg.
BEFORE: This is doing shuffle + sort over table scan outputs which is not needed as both tables are bucketed and sorted on the same columns and have same number of buckets. This should be a single stage job.
AFTER :

Thanks so what I think is really taking people with some surprise is that it registers Camel routes into the **same single camel context** from any bundles. The point of Apache Karaf was to be like an app server where each bundle is isolated. So this goes against this practice. This should be documented much much more clearly. And also it lacks features with the ease of use how to configure camel context itself (you end up with its defaults) and how would people do dependency injections for beans etc. 
Also it should be renamed to `camel-osgi-activator`, and moved to components (as its not a core piece, eg not used by other osgi like osgi blueprint which is the main osgi support in Camel).",documentation_debt,low_quality_documentation

trafficserver,5524,description,0,"This is an alternative to #5473.
I added an extra bit of code (which, unfortunately, would break the actual code if executed) to convince clang analyzer to shut up. I fiddled with this far more than I should and was unable to find any sort of assert
that would suppress the false positive. I _think_ the problem is the analyzer knows `x->_next == n` because of the previous code path, but doesn't realize `x->_next` gets updated when `n` is removed (via standard linked list removal). It's also annoying that the analyzer complains about the _assignment_ of a stale pointer as if it were a dereference. While dangerous, the assignment of `n = next(x)` is not actually a use after free. If I replace that with the content of the `next` function, however, the use after free moves to the next loop iteration, which would be correct if there was an actual use after free.
I prefer this because if the code is changed solely to make clang analyzer shut up, that should be obvious to a reader of the code, rather than puzzling over obtusely different implementation styles. It also means if we ever discuss this with the LLVM group, we can easily find the places in the code where the clang analyzer messes up.",non_debt,-

This is a latest discussion which also contains requirements of metrics feature. I don't think we should address all of them, but addressing most of them would be great.
http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/storm-dev/201605.mbox/%3CCAF5108jB=4aL0Z1qMMnEe7U4Yx_9TZjD11BJYhKtkTtVJoTdhQ@mail.gmail.com%3E
Adding fixes to current metrics seems not competitive to recent metrics from others stream frameworks, and even JStorm, which is the thing we would eventually evaluate (I already did a first pass and looks promising) and port if it's better. This patch only has a value with current metrics, and I don't want to break backward compatibility because of will-be-deprecated-and-dropped feature.",non_debt,-

bookkeeper,888,comment,352890209,"We assume that, for a given version, the notice and license files will not change, which is a safe assumption to make.
I'm dubious as to whether it will be possible to pull in NOTICE files automatically. We would have to pull in every NOTICE file, which isn't really necessary. And then someone would have to check the contents of the pulled in NOTICE file to ensure everything is ok.
If we make the pulling of licenses automatic, then they will only ever be checked at release time. At release time, all dependencies need to be checked, and when there's so much to check, people are likely to just give it a quick glance, and +1 it, without actually checking each dependency.
I would prefer that the work in manually checking dependencies occurs as part of the development process, each time we update a dependency. At this time, there will be a smaller subset of the dependencies changing, so it can be reviewed more carefully. The submitter will be able to take their time with it, and the reviewer will be able to give each dependency their full attention. Once a license/notice has been updated for a version of the dependency, it shouldn't need to be looked at again (as licenses/notices don't change within a single version).",design_debt,non-optimal_design

zeppelin,2120,comment,288543338,"Looking at the discussion and the different issues I see what you mean @1ambda. We are actually having two issues:
1. Local changes are overwritten when the notebook gets updates from the server (e.g. someone renames a note)
2. Local changes are not propagated on a regular basis (and you risk bigger conflicts when editing simultaneously)
The first point is addressed by #2176 #2177 more than this PR, because even when saving on losing focus you might risk losing local changes if you didn't lose the focus and someone renames, correct?
The second point is addressed in a way here but as mentioned in one of the other discussions we should really move towards real time updates where every keystroke gets transmitted (or at least while typing maybe after a few seconds) and you can see the cursor of the other users in your paragraph (similar to Google Docs).

brooklyn-server,835,review,142912453,"TL;DR: I agree this is fine. Below are some notes from digging around in the synchronization code.
Looking at the other synchronization blocks, `emitInternal` will synchronize on `EntityManagementSupport` instance (when it calls `getSubscriptionContext()`. It will then call `publish` which will synchronize on `LocalSubscriptionManager` instance (in `getSubscriptionsForEntitySensor`).
However, I think we can trust both the `EntityManagementSupport` and the `LocalSubscriptionManager` to not call out to alien code while holding a lock on itself. Therefore we should be safe in that respect.
The code in `AbstractEntity` and `AbstractGroupImpl` looks a bit scary, where it first gets the lock on this `values` object and then on either `abstractGroup.members` or `abstractEntity.children` (but it's kind-of understandable why it does that and how that pattern avoids it; it would just be nicer if instead we didn't call out to alient code while holding the lock on `values` - but that's a bigger discussion than for this PR):",code_debt,low_quality_code

storm,2790,comment,412260769,"@uddhavarote That's not how it works. The stream you emit to doesn't matter. As long as the tuple you emit from the KafkaBolt is anchored to the input tuple, the tuple will be replayed from the spout and go to the entire topology again if processing fails after the KafkaBolt.
Basically the choice you will have is to use`OutputCollector.emit(input, new Values(...))`, in which case the tuple gets replayed from the spout if processing fails in your bolt, or `(OutputCollector.emit(new Values(...))`, in which case the tuple does not get replayed and is lost if processing fails in your bolt.
That said, your application probably needs to deal with potential duplicate writes to Kafka anyway, so it might not be a big deal. I'm fine with adding the output collector and tuple to the callback. Please raise an issue at https://issues.apache.org/jira and feel free to submit a PR here that makes the change.",non_debt,-

couchdb,3172,description,0,"During the porting of rewrite_js.js tests into the elixir test suite I've found an erroneous behavior in the JS-rewrite functionality. 
When a rewritten request contains a BODY (POST/PUT) and the rewrite rule rewrites the query string, this query string is ignored in the final request. The following case illustrates this issue.
1 - Create a design document with a rule that rewrites the query string, like this one:
any request should be rewritten to `_changes?filter=_docs_ids`
2 - Create a couple of docs
3 - Perform a POST request to be rewritten
The expected result for this case is to have only the change for the doc with id 2 in the response, but the full change list is returned. The `filter=_doc_ids` is ignored after the rewritten.
This PR changes this behavior and the query string is preserved, so the result for the previous case is the excepted one returning only the change for the doc with id 2.
     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users
     could notice? -->

This additional column could be used to replace the subquery in Filter.
In theory, all the predicate subquery could use this join type, but it's slower than LeftSemi and LeftAnti, so it's only used for nested subquery (subquery inside OR).
For example, the following SQL:

lucene-solr,2336,description,0,"# Description
SOLR-13608 introduced support into Solr for an ""incremental"" backup file structure, which allows storing multiple backup points for the same collection at a given location.  With the ability to store multiple backups at the same place, users will need to be able to list and cleanup these backups.
# Solution
This PR introduces two new APIs: one for listing the backups at a given location (along with associated metadata), and one to delete or cleanup these backups.  The APIs are offered in both v1 and v2 flavors.
# Tests
Manual testing, along with new automated tests in `PurgeGraphTest` (reference checking for detecting index files to delete), `V2CollectionBackupsAPIMappingTest` (v1<->v2 mapping), and `AbstractIncrementalBackupTest` (integration test for list, delete functionality).

The followers will not even decompress the messages. If we play the trick here, the time index on follower will also be affected. 
If we want to make things right, then producer should be able to get the necessary topic configuration info from broker, either from TopicMetadataRequest or some other requests. So the producer can set the timestamp correctly to avoid server side recompression. But like you said this is a bigger change and it is unnecessary to block on that change.
I think the current solution is reasonably clean as of the moment.
Once the producer is able to get the topic configuration from broker, we can simply migrate to use that. Since everything is purely internal, the migration is very simple and transparent to users.",design_debt,non-optimal_design

1. LocalLAPACK and LocalARPACK shares similar upper bound, ""requested array exceeds vm limit""   when n = 17000. For 15000, it will take more than 5 hours but doable.
2. k is actually ignored in LocalLAPACK mode. It always computes full svd.
3. computeGramianMatrix also has upper limit somewhere < 17000. Actually that's why 1 fails at 17000. I'll look into it. Yet I need more time to locate the root cause for that.
4. Under DistARPACK mode, for 17K \* 17K full svd, I got a lot of future times out and job failed. I'm trying k = 10 with 17K \* 17K (1 hour now), and seems all worker CPUs are always idle.

airflow,7085,description,0,"Most of the executors run local task jobs by running `airflow tasks run ...`. This is achieved by passing  `['airflow', 'tasks', 'run', ...]` object to subprocess.check_call. 
This is very limiting when creating new executors that do not necessarily want to start a new process when starting a local task job, e.g. fork a process instead of create.
We could achieve a similar effect if we process back the argument list, but this is an ugly and hack solution, so I did refactor the code and now the executor passes the LocalTaskJobDeferredRun object that contains all the detailed information. A particular executor could create a command if it needs it.
This will facilitate the development of other executors:

drill,1593,description,0,"Currently, the WebServer side needs to process the entire set of results and stream it back to the WebClient, which puts immense pressure on the WebServer when rendering the resultset. 
Since the WebUI does paginate results, we can load a larger set for pagination on the browser client and relieve pressure off the WebServer to host all the data (most of which will never be streamed to the browser).
e.g. Fetching all rows from a 1Billion records table is impractical and can be capped at (say) 1K. Currently, the user has to explicitly specify LIMIT in the submitted query. 
An option is provided in the field to allow for this entry, and can be set to selected by default for the Web UI.
The submitted query indicates that an auto-limiting wrapper was applied.
In addition, the resultset is now configurable to allow for the default number or rows displayed per page to be changed from 10 to anything that the user might want.
Configuration additions in `drill-module.conf` (changes should be made in `drill-override.conf` ):

Graph providers may choose to implement their own methods for authorization in the manner they see fit.

beam,13984,comment,778422690,"The code that introduces a cleanup probably comes from:
The test creates a bunch of pipeline objects with references to them in the interactive environment. The test tries to find out whether a `cleanup(pipeline)` is invoked when explicitly tracking all user pipelines if some of the pipelines held in the environment is no longer in scope. Of all the pipeline objects created, only one would be cleaned up (because we intentionally put a string typed ""pipeline"" in the interactive environment so it would just ""disappear"" when tracking pipeline-typed objects), so cleanup should just be invoked once during the call.

In #4027 I added a bunch of exclusions to the `pom.xml` but they turned out to be redundant and the problem was something else IIRC.
There is a subtlety that I only just sorted out fully. The patterns in a `.gitignore` are resolved relative to the `.gitignore` but _also_ directories inherit the `.gitignore` from parent directories.
So when `.gitignore` contains `vendor/` this means that when `git` is working in `sdks/go` it will inherit the `vendor/` ignore pattern, and it will work. But when the working directory is the root, `sdks/go/vendor` is not ignored.

spark,4525,review,24634640,"So, this feels a little racy, in that this thread might miss things added by the log checking thread. I'd suggest the following:
- Create a single-threaded executor for running the replay tasks
- Create a list of app infos to parse in the log checking thread, break it down into batches.
- Submit each batch to the executor
Basically, instead of having `logLazyReplay`, you'd have something like `replay(apps: Seq[LazyAppInfo])`. You don't need `lazyApplications` because that becomes part of the task being submitted to the executor, so you solve another source of contention in the code. And since it's a single-threaded executor, you know there's only a single thread touching `apps`, so it should all be thread-safe.
For testing, you can use Guava's `sameThreadExecutor()` as I mentioned, instead of the single-threaded executor.",code_debt,low_quality_code

brooklyn-server,144,comment,222313156,"Worth adding test case(s).
Also note the related discussion the mailing list. An alternative suggestion is that we pick up _all_ files with the given name on the classpath (rather than all those in a given directory). I personally prefer the approach of all files in the directory. That would allow us to more easily incrementally add things (e.g. have separate files for upgrading between versions).
---
I wonder about a nicer package name than `org.apache.brooklyn.core.mgmt.persist.deserializingClassRenames`. I imagine many people will just put this in their `./conf/` directory, so we don't want them to have to create a really deep nested directory.
---
Another thing we could add (in the future?) is if there are conflicting changes - e.g. A is renamed to B in the first file, and B is renamed to C in the second file. Currently, the result would depend on the other the files were processed: i.e. it could be ""B"" or ""C"". It would be good to be more predictable.

1. StarTreeV2 is a compact memory representation of StarTree with native

   direct memory, or via memory mapped file. Used the Xerial LBuffer
   library to be able to support data sizes larger than 2GB.

   V1 that uses JAVA serialization/de-serialization.
3. Modified StarTreeIndexOperator to be able to work off of
   StarTreeInterf, which can be implemented either by StarTree or
   StarTreeV2.
4. Added a utility to convert a pinot segment with star tree v1 into a

spark,28163,description,0,"In the PR, I propose to optimise the `DateTimeUtils`.`rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` and `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` functions, and make them faster by using pre-calculated rebasing tables. This approach allows to avoid expensive conversions via local timestamps. For example, the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone has just a few time points when difference between Proleptic Gregorian calendar and the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian since 1582-10-15) is changed in the time interval 0001-01-01 .. 2100-01-01:
The difference in microseconds between Proleptic and hybrid calendars for any local timestamp in time intervals `[local timestamp(i), local timestamp(i+1))`, and for any microseconds in the time interval `[Gregorian micros(i), Gregorian micros(i+1))` is the same. In this way, we can rebase an input micros by following the steps:
1. Look at the table, and find the time interval where the micros falls to
2. Take the difference between 2 calendars for this time interval
3. Add the difference to the input micros. The result is rebased microseconds that has the same local timestamp representation.
Here are details of the implementation:
- Pre-calculated tables are stored to JSON files `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json` in the resource folder of `sql/catalyst`. The diffs and switch time points are stored as seconds, for example:
  The JSON files are generated by 2 tests in `RebaseDateTimeSuite` - `generate 'gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json'` and `generate 'julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json'`. Both tests are disabled by default. 
  The `switches` time points are ordered from old to recent timestamps. This condition is checked by the test `validate rebase records in JSON files` in `RebaseDateTimeSuite`. Also sizes of the `switches` and `diffs` arrays are the same (this is checked by the same test).
The hash maps store the switch time points and diffs in microseconds precision to avoid conversions from microseconds to seconds in the runtime.
- I moved the code related to days and microseconds rebasing to the separate object `RebaseDateTime` to do not pollute `DateTimeUtils`. Tests related to date-time rebasing are moved to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` for the same reason.
- I placed rebasing via local timestamp to separate methods that require zone id as the first parameter assuming that the caller has zone id already. This allows to void unnecessary retrieving the default time zone. The methods are marked as `private[sql]` because they are used in `RebaseDateTimeSuite` as reference implementation.
- Modified the `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` methods in `RebaseDateTime` to look up the rebase tables first of all. If hash maps don't contain rebasing info for the given time zone id, the methods falls back to the implementation via local timestamps. This allows to support time zones specified as zone offsets like '-08:00'.
To make timestamps rebasing faster:
- Saving timestamps to parquet files is ~ **x3.8 faster**
- Loading timestamps from parquet files is ~**x2.8 faster**.
- Loading timestamps by Vectorized reader ~**x4.6 faster**.
No
- Added the test `validate rebase records in JSON files` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite`. The test validates 2 json files from the resource folder - `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json`, and it checks per each time zone records that
  - the number of switch points is equal to the number of diffs between calendars. If the numbers are different, this will violate the assumption made in `RebaseDateTime.rebaseMicros`.
  - swith points are ordered from old to recent timestamps. This pre-condition is required for linear search in the `rebaseMicros` function.
- Added the test `optimization of micros rebasing - Gregorian to Julian` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` which iterates over timestamps from 0001-01-01 to 2100-01-01 with the steps 1 ± 0.5 months, and checks that optimised function `RebaseDateTime`.`rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` returns the same result as non-optimised one. The check is performed for the UTC, PST, CET, Africa/Dakar, America/Los_Angeles, Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Hong_Kong, Europe/Amsterdam time zones.
- Added the test `optimization of micros rebasing - Julian to Gregorian` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` which does similar checks as the test above but for rebasing from the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to Proleptic Gregorian calendar.
- Re-run `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` at the America/Los_Angeles time zone (it is set explicitly in the PR #28127):",code_debt,slow_algorithm

This PR is to fix the above issue. When building a data source, we introduce a flag `isSchemaFromUsers` to indicate whether the schema is really input from users. If true, we issue an exception.

I was wondering at some point if it would be worthwhile to just ""unsafe arraycopy"" the char[] from the string to the byte[] in the memory segments or stream buffers.

arrow,5508,comment,535832777,"@emkornfield I created a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of consumer directly. The improvement is not significant:
after: JdbcAdapterBenchmarks.consumeBenchmark  avgt    5  77326.747 ± 218.829  ns/op
before: JdbcAdapterBenchmarks.consumeBenchmark  avgt    5  79007.087 ± 63.994  ns/op
I think there are two reasons for this:
1. in our benchmark, the jdbc implementation is based on h2, and for this library the wasNull method implementation was simple: 
    @Override
    public boolean wasNull() throws SQLException {
        try {
            debugCodeCall(""wasNull"");
            checkClosed();
            return wasNull;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw logAndConvert(e);
        }
    }
It can be seen that the implementation is based on a simple flag, plus some simple checks. For other implementations with other RDBs, the implementation can be more heavy. For example, the following code gives the implementation of MySQL JDBC, which may involve megamorphic virtual calls:
  public boolean wasNull() throws SQLException {
    try {
      return this.thisRow.wasNull();
    } catch (CJException var2) {
      throw SQLExceptionsMapping.translateException(var2, this.getExceptionInterceptor());
    }
  }
2. The time for wasNull method was insignificant compared with the Arrow set methods.",code_debt,slow_algorithm

- we'll need to get all the version numbers aligned with whatever nifi version this would be committed into.  Currently that would be 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.
- It would probably be a good idea to have the notion of 'nifi-leaderelection-api' which is not about zookeeper but rather just generic election/tracking of a leader for a given thing (a partition?) Then there would be zookeeper based implementations of those.  Processors then can leverage the api for their code but users can select whichever types of services exist (zookeeper being the obvious initial example).  The structure appears already in place for this other than the current naming and perhaps the API referencing zookeeper.  Thoughts?

There doesn't seem to be an easy way to guarantee that if the new `current.jst` isn't successfully generated, the previous `current.jst` must be restored. So I still think modifying `FsDatasetStateStore.getLatestDatasetState` is a better approach. I don't think it violates any contract, because `current.jst` is just a convenient way to find the latest `jst` file (so that we don't need to list all `jst` files and sort them).

This change modifies the ""CI"" production image build to first:
1) Using 'pip download"" + constraints file it downloads all .wheel packages that are needed to install airflow with the chosen ""extras"" for the production image
2) Buillds all providers packages that are selected for the production
3) Builds airflow .whl package
4) Prepares the production image using those wheel files rather than PyPI.
This way this production image for development tests reflects the exact production ""content"" - all packages (including airflow) are installed, but at the same time we are using latest sources to build those packages, so the image can also be used in K8S tests because it is build from the current (PR) sources.

Gremlin Server no longer supports automatically creating self-signed certificates.
Cluster client no longer trusts all certs by default as this is an insecure configuration. (TINKERPOP-2022)
To revert to the previous behavior and accept all certs, it must be explicitly configured.
Introduces JKS and PKCS12 support. JKS is the legacy Java Key Store. PKCS12 has better cross-platform support and is gaining in adoption. Be aware that JKS is the default on Java 8.  Java 9 and higher use PKCS12 as the default. Both Java keytool and OpenSSL tools can create, read, update PKCS12 files.
Other new features include specifying SSL protocols and cipher suites.
The packaged `*-secure.yaml` files now restrict the protocol to `TLSv1.2` by default.
The implication of all of the above changes means that the packaged `*-secure.yaml` files no longer ""just work"". Minimally, the server files must be configured with a key/cert.
PEM-based configurations are deprecated, to be removed in a future release.

What I am thinking about (but I have not yet found a working implementation) is: since the problem arise when we say we expect `null` in a non-nullable datatype, can we add such a check? I mean, instead of pretending the expected value to be nullable, can't we add a check in case it is not nullable for being sure that it does not contain `null`? I think it would be better, because we would be able to distinguish a failure caused by a bad test, ie. a test written wrongly, from a UT failure caused by a bug in what we are testing.

- refactor manifest and deployment functions into parsers and readers

The features added in this code:
- support for multiple packages in the service deployer.  This is mainly targeted towards multiple packages in the deployment.yaml, not the manifest.yaml
- add parameter and annotation binding from the deployment file into the deployment plan.

this is continued from https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1559
Hi @davsclaus , @objectiser , 
Here is an outline sketch for the CAMEL-11054. Let's start from here:
* adds `addCamelLoggerListener()`/`getCamelLoggerListeners()` on `CamelContext`
* `CamelLogger` holds a list of `CamelLoggerListener`
* for Log EIP, `LogDefinition` copies `CamelLoggerListener`s from `CamelContext` to `CamelLogger`
* for Log Component, `LogEndpoint` copies `CamelLoggerListener`s from `CamelContext` to `CamelLogger`
* `CamelLoggerListener#onLog()` to receive a log event and return an enriched log message
Questions:
* do we want to extract `enrich()` from `onLog()` so it could be done separately?
* do we want separated handler like `onWarn()`, `onInfo()` and etc. rather than `onLog()`?
* any other event we want to handle in `CamelLoggerListener`?
* As both of Log EIP and Component use `CamelLogger`, it's easy to add it on both of them. Is it OK or do we want it only on Log EIP?

I added only the reshuffle and it seems to be a little bit helpful. I didn't optimise it further due to a  problem: different ""consolidatedHashes"" get calculated for each test run for datasets bigger than 600 000 rows. This makes it unable to determine hash for a large scale dataset (eg. 40 000 000 rows). The amount of read and written rows is the same. I also have the same problems while running JdbcIOIT on larger datasets. Also, as I checked, the database content seems to be all right. I can create a JIRA for that after you review this PR and agree that this behavior is odd, ok?
600 000 is approx. 160 MB. I wouldn't call that a large scale test but I think it is something we can start with and then increase the scale and optimize it gradually if needed and if possible (e.g. after tackling the hash calculaction problem i described). What do you think?",non_debt,-

tvm,7314,description,0,"This PR improves the implementation of GPU `argwhere` added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6868, using exclusive scan (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7303). 
The current implementation of `argwhere` is very inefficient, because it uses atomic to update the write location. Since all threads compete for the single location, this effectively makes it a sequential kernel. Moreover, since the output indices need to be lexicographically sorted, the current implementation involves sorting along each axis.
Since `argwhere` is literally an instance of stream compaction, this is a perfect application of exclusive scan. Now, `argwhere` simply consists of 
* A single call to exclusive scan on a boolean flag array to compute the write indices.
* Compaction using the write indices (just copying elements with nonzero condition).
both of which are highly parallel operation. Thus, both atomic and sort are gone, vastly simplifying the implementation. Moreover, it also brings huge speed up, as shown below.

spark,29715,comment,692354511,"No. That's a side improvement which can be dropped, not a major goal.
As I commented, fixing the problems on DataStreamWriter isn't the purpose of introducing DataStreamWriterV2. This is rather providing symmetric user experience between batch and streaming, as with DataFrameWriterV2 end users can go through running batch query with **catalog table** on writer side, whereas streaming query doesn't have something to enable this.
The problems I described in previous comment are simply the problems on Structured Streaming - let me explain at the end of comment, as it might be going to be out of topic.
I see DataFrameWriterV2 has integrated lots of other benefits (more fluent, logical plan on write node, etc.) which should be great to have in DataStreamWriterV2, but I think they're not a key part of *WriterV2. Supporting catalog table is simply the major reason to have it.
Regarding the problems on Structured Streaming - 
I kicked the incomplete state support on continuous mode out from Structured Streaming, but I basically concerns about ""continuous mode"" itself, as it's rather applying hacks to workaround architectural limitation. (+ No one cares about it in community.) 
And as I had initiated discussion earlier (and has been commented in various PRs), I think complete mode should be kicked out as well. The mode addresses some limited cases but is treated as one of valid modes which adds much complexity - some operations which basically shouldn't be supported in streaming query are supported under complete mode, and vice versa. Because the mode doesn't fit naturally.
It's useful for now because Spark doesn't support true update mode on sink - and once Spark can support update mode on sink, content in external storage should be just equivalent to what the complete mode provides, without having to dump all of the outputs. (Or that's just because of missing feature - queryable state.) Probably we can simulate complete mode via having a special stateful operator which only works with update mode.
Specific to micro-batch, supporting DSv1 is also a major headache - lots of pattern matchings in MicroBatchExecution are to support DSv1, and even there're workarounds applied for DSv1 (e.g #29700). I remember the answer in discussion thread that DSv1 for streaming data source is not exposed to the public API which is great news, but I see no action/plan to get rid of it.

flink,7186,review,238983295,"Sorry for late response because of a little busy these days.
I agree with your above comments. So whether the task executor can be released is based on whether there are active channels in this executor. The task executor can only exit after all the tcp connections are closed gracefully.
In theory as long as the downstream received all the data from the network, then the upstream side can be released normally, no need to wait all the received data are processed completely by downstream side. But we have on existing ack mechanism to notify upstream side of this, so it is easy to rely on close request currently.  Based on downstream's consumption to release upstream's resource, it may get extra benefits in failover scenarios in future for persistent output files in upstream side, because the upstream do not need to restart during consumption exception in downstream side.
But I just a little wonder it might bring potential effects in future via close request. For example, if there are 10 downstream tasks reuse the same tcp connection, and 9 tasks are finished earlier and only one tail task delay long to finish, then all the 10 partition views must be released together until the last downstream task finished. Although it might be no bad effects for delay releasing partition views currently.
I would continue reviewing other parts of this PR and it may take some days on my side. :)",non_debt,-

beam,7549,comment,455493852,"The names here are generally conventions.
In your client, you can do
    git remote -v
to list all your ""remotes"" i.e. other repositories that you push and pull
to. You can also do
    git branch
to list all your branches.
By default when you clone a fresh repository, you get a remote called
""origin"" that points to wherever you cloned it from. New (and most
existing) branches have a ""master"" branch by default (e.g. beam HEAD is the
master branch on https://github.com/apache/beam). So
    git pull --rebase=interactive origin master
pulls the branch ""master"" from the remote ""origin"" (presumably
github.com/apache/beam) into your own branch, and the --rebase=interactive
means take all your local commits and attempt to apply them on top of
origin/master, rather than creating a merge commit, interactively.
pulls all the remote changes into my repo (but not into any of my branches)
then ""git rebase [-i]"" rebases my current branch on top of it.
    git push [remote_name] [branch_name] [--force]
will push branch_name (defaults to the current branch) to remote (branches
can have a default remote set up) and the force means overwrite what's
there if it differs (needed after a rebase).
Another thing you can to save your work is if you're on a branch and
concerned about messing it up, you can do ""git checkout -b
some-branch-backup"" to make a copy of your current branch and then if you
mess up your current branch horrendously you can delete it (git branch -d
branch-name) and re-create the branch from your backup (git branch -b
some-branch some-branch-backup). Hopefully that's useful for being able to
experiment more freely, which will help in learning git.

samza,347,review,180646742,"I haven't measured how much time increase it causes. The purpose of this change is to make each test independent of each other. If we use BeforeClass and AfterClass tags, then these methods need to be static and the variables instantiated (i.e. producer, systemAdmin) needs to be static as well. These variables will then be instantiated exactly once for the test suite and used by all unit tests in this test suite. Thus kind allows interference between tests and make make test development difficult.
During development of this patch the interference must have caused some problem which required me to make this change. I don't exactly remember what that problem is now. But in general it seems like good practice to make unit test independent of each other. What do you think?",test_debt,expensive_tests

Fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10897
- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)
- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)
- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)
- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. 
- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. 
- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable
- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html
- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.
- Interesting edge cases to note here

 2. if someone is debugging a worker or its not responding jps can hang.
We may want to look at  using kill -0 for linux/mac as it will quickly tell you if its alive, not sure on windows, assume it would require something else.  Here is an stack overflow post that talks about it:

Note this is assuming you are saving the PID in the allocation file or using it from the PID directory.
I also think we should only run kill -0 or whatever when it is absolutely necessarily. Meaning the Worker can't allocate anything and then I would only look at the exact PIDS that have something allocated.",non_debt,-

trafficserver,7279,description,0,"Some messages get excessively noisy under high traffic conditions if
something about their mechanism goes wrong. The pipe logging feature,
for instance, will emit warning and error messages on every single log
event if the reader goes down or the pipe buffer fills up. This can
result in thousands of log messages being emitted per second, which
makes reading the logs difficult and causes disk space issues.
This commit addresses this issue by adding throttled versions of the
common logging messages so they only emit a message on some set
interval (60 seconds as a default). The following functions are added:
SiteThrottledStatus
SiteThrottledNote
SiteThrottledWarning
SiteThrottledError
SiteThrottledFatal
SiteThrottledAlert
SiteThrottledEmergency
As a bonus, these are implemented using a generic Throttler class which may also be
useful in other applications where throttling is desired.",design_debt,non-optimal_design

A preview is available at http://ec2-54-152-159-175.compute-1.amazonaws.com///api/python/ndarray.html
The refactor consists
1. operators that should be deprecated are removed from the summary list, including
2. we are agreed to use lower cases for array operators, so several alias are added.
3. bug fix for `rint` and `fix`. 
4. updated mxnet.css
For example, we used several input names including
we can use either 1) `data`, or `data0`, `data1` for multi-input, or 2) `a`, `b` to stay the same with numpy
Also we used `axis`, `axes`, `dim` to refer to dimensions. Suggest to use `axis` for single dimension and `axes` for multi-dimensions.

This patch won't preserve extension compatibility anyway, since Query gained `withQueryMetrics` but BaseQuery doesn't provide a default implementation.
But also: is there a nice migration path from this change now, to something that would be a ""better"" design for 0.11.0? From your discussion with @himanshug, it sounds like there isn't, and in 0.11.0 we'd just want to remove these methods we're adding now and replace them with something else.

For most of cases in the code, we returns the same references by well-design the `rules` for a `TreeNode` object, and if the code still keep creating the identical objects(`.equals` returns `true`) in its rule for every iteration, even unnecessary, can this be considered as a bug of the user code? 
I think it's the responsibility for user code to decide whether `TreeNode` object substitutions should be taken (via creating new instance), as user code always knows when a object substitution needed, right? That's also give more freedom for user code to define the `.equals()` in a semantic way for `TreeNode` object.",non_debt,-

In many cases, it's possible to work with both 2.11 and 2.12 with compiled binaries. We have two internal versions of Spark that we do this with, although Spark defines the catalog and table APIs in Java so we have less to worry about. Ideally, we would have one module that works with both and we would have some plan to test that. Otherwise, it's probably a good idea to move this code into Flink as soon as possible because it makes more sense to maintain just source compatibility there.
For now, I think we should consider options for testing this against both 2.11 and 2.12. Maybe we can add a build property to switch between 2.11 and 2.12 and just test both in CI.

2. The contract for enrichers/policies/entities/locations to be instantiated through the `EnricherSpec` etc is that the class must have a no-arg constructor. We don't expect people to call this constructor directly.
The second point means we probably should include the constructor with a comment. We could maybe even change `InternalPolicyFactory` etc so that it can handle calling protected constructors, which would enforce that more.

beam,7237,comment,447180932,"I am just starting to review, but I want to get some principles out beforehand:
1. The shaded path should absolutely never be used. It is derived from the module name just to make it unique. The reason we shade is as a way to isolate ""implementation detail"" dependencies. If this ends up on an API surface that is a bug. We had some tests for this, but they have rotted.
2. We work pretty hard to avoid Guava on the API surface, since the risk of diamond dependency conflicts is very high.
3. It is OK for an IO to have its own esoteric dependencies - including Guava - if the thing it is connecting to requires it. So if it is _Cassandra_ that requires Gauva on the API surface, then it can be included in the deps.
4. For those situations where Beam wants to use Guava internally, we are (slowly) moving to depend on `beam-vendored-guava-20_0`",design_debt,non-optimal_design

incubator-mxnet,14173,comment,476056958,"Thanks @ptrendx @eric-haibin-lin this is no FP16 GEMM from Intel MKL/MKL-DNN till now so I think we have to fall back to FP32 GEMM or simulated FP16 GEMM (maybe from `mshadow` or other BLAS library).
The current design is good for APEX.  I am thinking about a general solution for mixed precision training, such as INT8, FP16, BF16, FP32. The different HW supports for the different data type, like INT8 in CPU and small GPU chip and BF16 on CPU and FP16 on GPU. So we need more flexibility for data type change or other library integration.
We are going to support BF16 and the ideal situation is the user can switch FP16 and BF16 based on the devices transparently.
We are looking into the changes and will give back more details later.",non_debt,-

camel,1938,comment,387427803,"@koscejev , it is up to users what they want to convey in headers of camel exchange.

I am not sure what you mean about camel being protocol agnostic vs setting header. setting of a header value is users preference and setting special  headers like HTTP_QUERY is also user's preference as it is optional and if you set explicity, i think you should know what you need to do with path param. (it should be URL encoded in your case).
This is just IMHO. @davsclaus , @zregvart @WillemJiang @stsiano  may also have a comment on it.

You are right for `IsNull`. I pointed out this in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17680#discussion_r112285883 as it looks they (almost) always evaluate it to `true` in Parquet-side but it is filtered in Spark-side.

This commit adds support for mini-batch based gradient descent for MLP.
If the input table contains a 2D matrix for independent variable,
minibatch is automatically used as the solver. Two minibatch specific
optimizers are also introduced: batch_size and n_epochs.
- batch_size is defaulted to min(200, buffer_size), where buffer_size is
  equal to the number of original input rows packed into a single row in
  the matrix.
- n_epochs is the number of times all the batches in a buffer are
  iterated over (default 1).
Other changes include:
- dependent variable in the minibatch solver is also a matrix now. It
  was initially a vector.
- Randomize the order of processing a batch within an epoch.
- MLP minibatch currently doesn't support weights param, an error is
  thrown now.
- Delete an unused type named mlp_step_result.
- Add unit tests for newly added functions in python file.

5. I don't see where the semantics of any of the `GremlinDriverIntegrateTest` tests changed so it seems you accomplished this fix without breaking behavioral changes in the driver...that's nice.
6. Maybe I missed it but was there a test in Gremlin Server to validate any of this change - perhaps it was already better tested by way of your `SimpleWebSocketServer` tests?

spark,228,comment,39641216,"Hi, @pwendell , Thank you for your comments, here is my reply
First, ""whether accumulator value should be subject to change in the case of failure""...I think no, though during a long period, Spark runs in this way (this patch is actually resolving a very old TODO in DAGScheduler.scala)...I think accumulator is usually used to take the task which is more complicate than rdd.count/rdd.filter.count (Maybe I'm wrong), e.g. counting the sum of distance from the points to a potential center in K-means (see mllib), I think in this case, the health status of the cluster should be transparent to the user, i.e. the final result of K-means should be irrelevant to whether executor is lost, etc....
Second, Good point, I can understand what the use scenario is, but do you mind providing more details like how to implement this in Spark? I guess this can be solved by providing a approximateValue API in Accumulator or SparkContext....
Third, actually, this patch ensures that the value of the accumulator in a stage will only be available when this stage becomes independent (means that no job needs it any more, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/228/files#diff-6a9ff7fb74fd490a50462d45db2d5e11L400), if a job finishes, and the other job still needs the certain stage, the accumulator value calculated in that stage will not be counted...",design_debt,non-optimal_design

On the other hand, an unbounded cache here will probable lead to trouble for some users in a multi-user or long-running Spark app such as the thriftserver.
Right now I'm thinking the `InMemoryCache` is okay as-is because this feature is behind a configuration flag, but I think we'll need a resource-sensitive solution in order to support this cache in the thriftserver.",non_debt,-

JIRA epic can be found here: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1335>
The examples has been modified from D2L Gluon [book](http://d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing/index.html). This examples shows that the fit() API helps in reducing the training script by approx. 25 lines, and also the target users doesn't need to write their own training loop.
Note: We have covered some of the models, more to be added soon.  
- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)
- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)
- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)
- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. 
- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. 
- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable
- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html

This PR changed or added the following APIs:
`ColumnVector ColumnVector.allocate(int capacity, DataType type, MemoryMode mode, boolean useUnsafeArrayData)`

`int ColumnVector.putArray(int rowId, ArrayData array)`

tinkerpop,889,comment,408684427,"@jorgebay I've modified the Sasl Authenticator so that a mechanism can now be passed in along with any mechanism options. I've changed the Sasl Plain Authenticator to mimic the Java handler code as discussed, however I had to do some fudging as I couldn't get the flow to work right. 
From my understanding of the Java code the Driver/Handler/GremlinSaslAuthenticationHandler class receives a 407 from the Gremlin Server and then sends a message containing { saslMechanism: 'PLAIN', sasl: (A base64 encoded null byte string) }, the server then returns an initial response and the client then sends the actual sasl authentication message... I tried that and I was getting a message that ""Authentication ID must not be null"". Having looked at the Gremlin Server code and the Handler/SaslAuthenticationHandler class and the Auth/SimpleAuthentication class it doesn't appear that saslMechanism token is actually parsed and the the server expects the actual sasl message right away. So, currently, in the JS SaslAuthenticator class I've passed the full Sasl message with the initial SaslMechanism argument. 
I hope that makes sense and if it needs changing I'm happy to do so.",non_debt,-

This could also be added as a call on ParDo, but providing a standalone PTransform seemed cleaner.
The series of operations adds more to the execution graph than I'd like; a dotted-line dependency would be better.  Not sure if this is easy to fix though.

Since you are active contributor, I want to give two recommendation.

flink,3520,description,0,"This PR is based on #3166 , and added following changes:
1. Refactor `RexProgramExpressionExtractor` and `RexProgramExpressionExtractor` to `RexProgramExtractor` and `RexProgramRewriter`. `RexProgramExtractor` is responsible for retract either projection expressions or filter expression.
2. Make sure we don't fail during extracting and converting filter RexNodes to expressions. The expressions which successfully translated and unconverted RexNodes will both be returned.
3. Add some tests for `RexProgramExtractor`.
4. Provide unified `PushFilterIntoTableSourceScanRuleBase` to support filter push down in both batch and stream mode.
5. Add some logical tests for filter push down in different situations, like fully push down and partial push down.
6. Slight change of testing class `TestFilterableTableSource` to make it less specialized.
Another thing to notice is that UDF expression can not be translated from RexCall to Expression yet, since the name is not consistent with the name in FunctionCatalog due to the change of #3330. We can revisit this issue later since it's not very practicable for a TableSource can understand and execute UDF registered in Flink.",non_debt,-

spark,3121,comment,62032343,"@JoshRosen I don't think the situation is quite a dire as you suggest (every line of test code?).

We can then turn the data objects into traits that are mixed into the test cases they need.  As long some SQLContext is in scope, and the required tables are added to that context during the constructor I don't anticipate any major problems.
Hive is going to be another story.  The whole reason for this singleton context pattern is that we have problems initializing more than one HiveContext in a single JVM.  If you try to do that all DDL operations fail with a mysterious `Database default does not exist` error.

airflow,1435,comment,215288030,"Much thanks for the in-depth review!
Is the scenario you are worrying about (two workers running the same task instance) already possible? For example if a worker's communication with the DB gets interrupted, then the scheduler assigns the task instance to a new worker, and then the communication between the initial worker and the DB resumes.
This makes sense. I misspoke in the PR description though, SLAs should still be sent, the difference would be the SLA email would now omit task instances in the dagrun that didn't succeed for reasons other than depends_on_past not being met (e.g. a task that couldn't run because it's pool was full won't get reported in the email). I think I'm going to just include all tasks that don't have a successful status in the SLA miss email, even those stuck on depends_on_past to align with your criteria (if the task caused core_data to not be delivered by 9AM the task caused the DAG to miss it's SLA regardless of it's depends_on_past_dependency), plus is stops treating depends_on_past differently from the other dependencies like the pool being full. LMK what you think.
Agreed about the efficiency, was going to look into caching if this causes perf issues.
The newfound power of the force flag could be used instead of ignore_depends_on_past, but making ""force"" the default for every backfill could potentially be a bit dangerous as users could e.g. unintentionally force run over a large range of already successful tasks in a backfill or violate a pool constraint. If you have any ideas let me know.
Agreed about not passing in a bunch of different flags. There is actually a TODO above that part of the code in the PR to use a context parameter instead (it will be addressed in this PR).
For the flag upstream_failed I would prefer to leave the fix for another PR since it was an existing hack and the cope of this PR is already a bit dangerously large.",code_debt,low_quality_code
